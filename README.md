# Streamers App Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for the Streamers App, an application that allows users to discover and interact with their favorite streamers.

## Getting Started

To run the frontend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the development server by running `npm start`. This will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Please note that the backend server is required for full functionality. Follow the instructions in the [backend repository](https://github.com/danielchochlinski/streamer-task-backend) to run the backend server locally.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Please note that `npm start` is also used for testing MongoDB Atlas.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode with [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) as the base URL. This assumes you have the backend server running on [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081). To run the app in development mode with the backend, open the backend repository and run `npm run dev` to start the backend server.
